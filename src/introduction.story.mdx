# Installation

Install `react-bulma-components` with your favorite package manager:

```
npm i react-bulma-components
```

In v4, Bulma is no longer bundled, and you have to install and import Bulma CSS yourself:

```
npm i bulma
```

Then in your top level component file (`App.js` for example), import the CSS file:

```js
import React from 'react';

// other imports...

import 'bulma/css/bulma.min.css';

function App() {
  /* ... */
}
```

## SASS support

Since CSS logic is separated from this library, there is no special setup required with the library. Simply follow
the [instructions](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/modular/) in the official documentation. You only need to
make sure the CSS is properly imported for your website.

<br />

# Usage

All components are exported under the `react-bulma-components` namespace:

```js
import { Container, Button, Form } from 'react-bulma-components';
```

Starting from v4, tree shaking is supported, so only the code of the components you have imported will be bundled.
