# Table

Change how the native progress bar looks line on the browser to match your design line

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Table} />

### Selected State

To avoid creating a unnecesary component for the table row, we didn't expose the selected as others options, for this you will need to use the classname `is-selected` on the `tr` you want

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Default} name="Table" />
</Canvas>
