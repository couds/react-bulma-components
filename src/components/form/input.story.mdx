The `Form.Input` component is an HTML `<input>` under the hood, with several Bulma-specific props.

## Props

On top of the attributes of the `<input>` element, this component also accepts the following props.

<ArgsTable of={Input} />

## Colors

Like many other Bulma components, you can apply different Bulma color variants to `Form.Input` via the `color` prop.
The color will be applied to the border of the input box.

<Story story={stories.Colors} />

## States

`Form.Input` can also be in different states:

<Story story={stories.States} />

<br />

### Static and readonly inputs

A `Form.Input` can also be `readOnly` and `static`, via the `readOnly` prop and `isStatic` prop.

A `static` input looks like normal text (i.e. it does not have a border),
and the `readOnly` prop is automatically set to `true`.

<Story story={stories.Readonly} />

## Sizes

You can change the size of `Form.Input` using the `size` prop:

- `"small"`,
- normal (you pass nothing to the prop)
- `"medium"`
- `"large"`

<Story story={stories.Sizes} />

## Rounded

You can make the left and right side of `Form.Input` to be rounded with the `rounded` prop.

<Story story={stories.Rounded} />

## Icons

As demonstrated previously, you can add icons on the left and right of an input.

1. Use the `iconLeft` and `iconRight` boolean props of `Form.Control` to indicates which side(s)
   you want the icons to appear on.
2. Put at most 2 `Icon` components in `Form.Control`
3. Specify the alignment of the `Icon`(s) via the `align` prop (`"left"` or `"right"`).
   **Note that one side can only have one icon**.

Icons will scale with the size of the input and will always be centered.
