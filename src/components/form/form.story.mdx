# Form

The `Form` namespace contains all components available to build forms.

## Components

| Components       | Descriptions                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Form.Checkbox`  | Displays a checkbox                         |

## Basic example

## Field

The `Field` component defines a field in a form. It can contain:

- A `Label` component to describe the `Field`
- A `Control` component to embed an input control
- A `Help` component to show instructions under the control.

<br />

<Story story={stories.FieldExample} />

<br />

Use the `Field` component to ensure consistent spacing between fields in a form.

<Story story={stories.MultipleFields} />

<br />

### Disabling fields

You can disable one or multiple `Field`s by wrapping the ones you want to disable in a `<fieldset>` html element with
the `disabled` attribute.

  <Story story={stories.DisablingFields} />

## Control

The `Control` component allows you to do the following:

- combine multiple `Control`s into groups
- add icons to the wrapped form controls at the start and at the end.

You can only wrap the following components with `Control`:

- `Input`
- `Select`
- `Button`
- `Icon`

### Adding icons

To add icons to a form control, use the `iconLeft` and the `iconRight` prop of the `Control` component
to indicate which side you want the icons to appear. Then, put an `Icon` component _in_ the `Control` component
with the `align` prop to indicate whether you want to icon to appear on the `'left'` or on the `'right'`.

  <Story story={stories.FormControlIcons} />
</Canvas>

### Grouping controls

To group multiple controls together, use `kind="group"` prop on the `Field` component, and then simply put
multiple controls inside the `Field`.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.GroupedControls} />
  <Story story={stories.GroupedButtons} />
</Canvas>

You can change the alignment of a control group using the `align` prop of the `Field` component. Possible values are
`centered` and `right`. By default, controls in a control group are aligned to the left.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.ControlGroupAlignment} />
</Canvas>

You can also tell a control in a control group to take up as much width as possible in the group by using the
`fullwidth` prop of the `Control` component.

<Story story={stories.ExpandedControl} />

<br />

Controls in a control group can also take up multiple lines. Simply specify `multiline` on the `Field` component.

<Story story={stories.MultilineControls} />

## Horizontal forms

You can make field labels sit next to field controls by making use of the `horizontal` prop of the `Field` component,
and using the `Form.Field.Label` and the `Form.Field.Body` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.HorizontalForm} />
</Canvas>

### Label sizes

You can adjust the sizes of horizontal labels: `"small"`, `"normal"`, `"medium"`, `"large"`.
