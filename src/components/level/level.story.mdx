# Level

A layout component that aligns children horizontally.

## Usage

The `Level` component has the following structured:

- `<Level>`: The main container
  - `<Level.Side align="left">` aligns its children to the left side of `Level`
  - `<Level.Side align="right">` aligns its children to the right side of `Level`
    - `<Level.Item>` represents the individual items in `Level`. **Content of `Level.Item` will be vertically centerd**.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Default} />
</Canvas>

### Centered

If `Level.Item` is directly under `Level`, they will be evenly spaced in the container.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Centered} />
</Canvas>

### Mobile level

By default, `Level` is vertical on mobile (meaning it will align its items vertically). You can enable the `mobile` prop
so that `Level` will remain horizontal on mobile.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.MobileLevel} />
</Canvas>
