  - `<Modal.Card>`: A more classic modal with head, body and footer
    - `<Modal.Card.Header />` The header of the modal, here you can use the `Modal.Card.Title` component, or your own custom component
    - `<Modal.Card.Title />` Normally used as a children of `Modal.Card.Head`
    - `<Modal.Card.Body />` The main content of the modal, if the height its bigger that the viewport will generate scroll inside this component
