# Columns

A flexbox based column system.

## Props

<br />

### `Columns`

<ArgsTable of={Columns} />

### `Columns.Column`

<ArgsTable of={Columns.Column} />

## Basic

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

You can build columns very easily:

1. Add a `<Columns />` component
2. Put as many `<Columns.Column />` as you want inside it.

All columns will be equally sized.

## Gap

You can customize the gaps between columns

### Default gap

By default, columns have gaps equal to the value of `$column-gap`, which is `0.75rem` by default.  
Note that it applies to **individual** column, so the gap between two adjacent columns will be twice of `$column-gap`.

---

### Gapless

Don't want any gaps between columns? Simply use the `gapless` prop and set it to true.

<Story story={stories.Gapless} />

---

### Breakpoint-based gaps

You can specify different gap values for different viewport sizes via the `variableGap` prop, from 0 to 9. 0 means gapless,
and 3 is the default gap value.

```
<Columns
  variableGap={{
    mobile: 1,
    tablet: 0,
    desktop: 3,
    widescreen: 8,
    fullhd: 2,
  }}
>
  ...
```

## Sizes

You can adjust the size of individual columns.

### Proportions

You can adjust the size of each column using proportions:

- `"three-quarters"`
- `"two-thirds"`
- `"half"`
- `"one-third"`
- `"one-quarter"`
- `"full"`
- `"four-fifths"`
- `"three-fifths"`
- `"two-fifths"`
- `"one-fifth"`

Just pass them to the `size` prop, and they will size themselves according to the given proportions.
For example, a column with `size` `"two-thirds"` will occupy two third of the available space.

If nothing is passed to `size`, then the column will occupy the remaining space.

<Story story={stories.ProportionalSizes} />

---

### 12 Columns system

The grid is divided into 12 columns, and you can specify how many columns each column occupies with the `size` prop.

For example, a column with `size={7}` will occupy 7 of the 12 columns.

<Story story={stories.TwelveColumns} />

---

### Offset

You can use the `offset` prop to offset a column by the specified value. It accepts all values that `size` does.

For example, a column can have `size` of `half` while being offset from the left by `one-quarter`.

<Story story={stories.Offset} />

---

## Responsiveness

You can use the `breakpoint` prop to specify at what viewport size `Columns` should be "activated",
meaning it will display `Columns.Column` in a row. Any viewport smaller
than the specified viewport size will cause `Columns` to display `Columns.Column`
in a column.

By default, the value is `'tablet'`. Any viewport smaller than `'tablet'` will cause `Columns` to stack
`Columns.Column` on top of each other.

### Activate column layout on mobile

Use `breakpoint="mobile"` to tell `Columns` to activate the column layout on any mobile (or bigger) viewport.

<Story story={stories.MobileColumns} />

### Column layout on desktop (and bigger viewport) only

Use `breakpoint="desktop"` to tell `Columns` to activate the column layout _only_ on viewport that is at least as big as `'desktop'`.

<Story story={stories.DesktopColumns} />

### Other viewport sizes

- `'widescreen'`
- `'fullhd'`

---

### Customize columns for different viewports

A `<Columns.Column>` can have different configurations on different breakpoints.

<Story story={stories.BreakpointBasedSizes} />

```
<Columns.Column
  mobile={{
    size: 'three-quarters',
  }}
  tablet={{
    size: 'two-thirds',
  }}
  desktop={{
    size: 'one-third',
  }}
  widescreen={{
    size: 'half',
  }}
  fullhd={{
    size: 'two-thirds',
  }}
>
```

You can also customize:

- `offset`: the offset of the column from the left, as described in the offset section; and
- `narrow`: whether the column should be narrow (boolean)

for each column.

---

## Nesting

You can nest `Columns` inside any `Columns.Column` indefinitely.

In this example, the numbers represent the nesting level the `Columns.Column` is in.

<Story story={stories.Nesting} />

---

## Other options

There are couple other options that you can use to customize column behaviors further.

### Vertically centered content

By default, `Columns.Column` are aligned to top the in `Columns`. You can set the `vCentered` prop to true so that they are
vertically centered instead.

<Story story={stories.VerticallyCenteredContent} />

### Horizontally centered columns

Along with vertically centering columns, you can also horizontally center them with the `centered` prop.

<Story story={stories.HorizontallyCenteredContent} />

### Multiline columns

Instead of using multiple `Columns` component, you can use the `multiline` prop, which allows more columns to fit
in different rows.

<Story story={stories.MultilineColumns} />
