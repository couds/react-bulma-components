# Colums gap

You can customize the gaps between columns

### Default gap

By default, columns have gaps equal to the value of `$column-gap`, which is `0.75rem` by default.
Note that it applies to **individual** column, so the gap between two adjacent columns will be twice of `$column-gap`.

---

### Gapless

Don't want any gaps between columns? Simply use the `gapless` prop and set it to true.

### Breakpoint-based gaps

You can specify different gap values for different viewport sizes via the `variableGap` prop, from 0 to 9. 0 means gapless,
and 3 is the default gap value.
