## The `renderAs` prop

Under the hood, each Bulma component has a specified default `renderAs` component
that they will use to render, along with all the generated Bulma classes.

For example, `Container` is rendered as:

```
<div class="container ...">
```

and `Button` is rendered as:

```
<button class="button ...">
```

Every Bulma component accepts attributes or props of the elements or components
they will be rendered as. `Container` accepts all HTML attributes of `<div>`, and `Button`
accepts all HTML attributes of `<button>`.

Sometimes, however, you may want a Bulma component to be rendered as another React component or as another HTML element.
This is where the `renderAs` prop that is available to every component comes in handy.

### Render with a different HTML element

You can use the `renderAs` prop to specify what HTML element you want the component to render with.
For example, a `Button` can be rendered as an `input` instead of a `button`:

```js
<Button renderAs="input" />
```

`Button` will now be rendered as an `<input>`; all the attributes of `<input>` is also available as props.

### `react-router`

One of the very common use case of `renderAs` is [integrating with `react-router`](https://github.com/couds/react-bulma-components/issues/55).
You can instruct a Bulma component to render using the `Link` component from `react-router`:

```js
<Button renderAs={Link} color="primary" to="/login" />
```

Using the `renderAs` prop, all Bulma classes are forwarded to the `Link` component, and all
props of the `Link` components are exposed correctly.

### What about TypeScript?

The TypeScript definition that is shipped with this library correctly identifies the props
of the component that is passed to `renderAs` and will add the type information to the Bulma component itself.
