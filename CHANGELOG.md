# Changelog

## 3.3.0

- Add `CHANGELOG.md`

- Bump Bulma version to `0.8.2`

  - `<Panel />` component now supports `color` prop which is exactly the same as
    other component that supports color, like `<Button />`

  - New modifier: `colorVariant`. Accepts two values: `'light'` and `'dark'`.
    It is equivalent to Bulma's `is-light` and `is-dark` modifier.
  
  - For changelog of Bulma `0.8.2`, see [here](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#082)
